# Phoenix Live Page Starter App
This starter app uses:

  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for code editing
  * Development in [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com) via the [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
  * [ElixirLS for VS Code](https://github.com/JakeBecker/vscode-elixir-ls) for Elixir support in VS Code
  * [ExGuard](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_guard) to automatically run tests, etc.
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for styling and components
  * [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for icons


## Development

  * Install dependencies with the `Mix - deps.get` Task

  * Migrate the database with the `Mix - ecto.migrate` Task
  * Install web assets (Node.js dependencies etc.) with the `Install Assets` Task
